## Overview

- Search Baldur's Gate 3's audio files by dialogue, character and filename. Database contains all .wem files stored in english.pak and SharedSounds.pak.
- Download results in .csv format.
- Ability for the community to edit database entries to improve accuracy.

## Installation

- Online web app with edit feature <a href="https://nocomplydev.pythonanywhere.com/">here</a> (recommended).
- Offline via Github: Just download, run app.py and copy the link provided by your terminal into your browser. I'll update the repo with the live database every week or so.

## Use Cases

- For modding dialogue audio in Baldur's Gate 3.

## More Information & Usage

### Database Creation and Accuracy

Localization files are (mostly) referenced in english.loca along with the relevant subtitle. Accuracy for these should be 100%. The 5% or so that aren't referenced were run through OpenAI Whisper Large model and then cleaned up manually. Character names were scraped from Pandora's list of Voice UUIDs.

SharedSounds was harder:

• There are no subtitles for these so I ran the whole directory through OpenAI Whisper Large model (compute time: 141 hours, my CPU is screaming at me). Accuracy for any of these files that contain dialogue should be 90-100%.

• SharedSounds character names are currently only added for the files listed in TealRabbit19's Point-Click Dialogue Files Database. While endlessly useful, by the creator's own admission this database is not 100% exhaustive/accurate.

• **_For any files in SharedSounds that don't contain dialogue, Whisper will likely have printed garbled nonsense/bizarre sentences._** If you find any of these feel free to submit an edit on the web app. I've cleared out some already but with 200,000+ entries there will still be plenty.

It is not impossible that some files have been missed - I am far from the best at coding and pretty much everything was scraped/moved/imported using one thrown-together-at-2am python script or another. That being said, I'm pretty confident that it's all there.

### Community Editing

Any entries/sections of entries that are not definitively 100% accurate have an edit feature. Anyone can access this via the <a href="https://nocomplydev.pythonanywhere.com/">web app</a> and submit revisions. All revisions are sent to me for verification - I go through them every few days or so. Remember, this is a search-based database - if you submit anything, make sure it's accurate and that your spelling/grammar is correct.

Abuse of the edit feature (multiple incorrect submissions, multiple submissions with bad spelling/grammar, trolling etc.) will result in an immediate IP ban.

The offline version does not include an edit feature. If you want to make edits, either contribute to the project by using the web app or use any SQL database editor on your offline database.db file.

### Usage Examples

You can use multiple search boxes to execute more complex queries, e.g. searching 'Astarion' in Characters and 'tadpole' in Dialogue will return all instances of Astarion saying tadpole. These work together as 'and' functions, not 'or' functions, i.e. searching for 'Astarion' in Characters and 'Gale' in Characters would return nothing as there is no character with both of those names.

'Type' refers to the type of dialogue. Localization files have two types:

```
Localization (Subtitled)
Localization - Not In English.loca
```

For the types in SharedSounds, I have referred to the resource identifiers in /[PAK]\_Vocals/\_merged.lsf. They are as follows:

```
Action_Attack
Action_Attack Stealth
Action_BuffTarget
Action_BuffTarget Negative
Action_BuffTarget Postive
Action_BuffTarget Romance

Action_BuffTarget Stealth Negative
Action_BuffTarget Stealth Positive

ReptAction_PortraitClick

```

Sometimes these have character-specific modifiers appended such as `(Durge)` for dark urge-specific lines. These are not currently available to select in the edit dropdown as the use cases are fairly limited, but I may get around to it eventually.

## Planned Features

Updates will only be worked on if and when the tool is in regular, active use by community members.

- Add audio file lengths. Could be useful for localization mods, as these are required to be the same length or shorter than the vanilla files in order to play correctly in-game without cutting off.
- Add editable, searchable 'Notes' section for database entries.
- (Long-term) Inject local database changes either directly into english.loca OR create english.xml mod file with local changes. Useful for easy subtitle creation when replacing dialogue with original lines.

## Special Thanks

- **Pandora (Nexus)**, for their list of Voice UUIDs. Invaluable.
- **TealRabbit19 (Nexus)**, for their extraordinary labour of love in manually creating their Dialogue Files Database. Your patience astounds me.
- **Larian Studios**, for their support of the modding community.
